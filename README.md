## 👋 **A Message from Our Team**

Hello everyone!

We are a team of four passionate and cooperative students from IIT Patna, and we are incredibly proud to present **StudyGenie Ultimate**—our official submission for the **AIGNITION 2025 Hackathon**.

When we came together for this competition, our goal was to build something that would genuinely solve the problems we all face as students. We wanted to move beyond the boring, fragmented study tools out there and create an all-in-one ecosystem that is not only powerful but also incredibly engaging. This project is the result of countless hours of collaboration, brainstorming, and our shared passion for technology and innovation.

What truly sets StudyGenie apart is its **immersive 3D interface**. We poured our hearts into creating a futuristic and visually stunning experience using advanced CSS and JavaScript. Our platform features a beautiful glassmorphism design, floating particles, and interactive parallax effects that bring the user interface to life.

This project is our entry for **Track 4: AI for Productivity**, and we believe it perfectly addresses the challenge of creating an "AI-powered lecture summarizer" and an "adaptive study planner and learning companion."

We hope you'll see the dedication and teamwork that went into every line of code and every pixel on the screen.
